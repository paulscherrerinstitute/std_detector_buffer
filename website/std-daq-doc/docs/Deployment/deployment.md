# Deployment

Release of `std-daq` is done automatically into [packages](packages.md). The installation/deployment process can be done in multiple ways depending on the users. `std_daq` is tested against a set of ansible deployments in [this repository](https://git.psi.ch/std_daq_configs/sls/poc_fast_deploy) and the ansible role [psi.std_daq_deploy](https://git.psi.ch/controls-ci/psi.std_daq_deploy) is developed alongside.
