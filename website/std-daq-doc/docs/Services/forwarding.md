# Data Forwarding

The services detailed in this section ensure the seamless transfer of [metadata streams](../Interfaces/protobuf.md) and image data held in [RAM buffers](../Interfaces/ringbuffer.md) between servers. This data retains the format provided by the [data acquisition](acquisition.md) services, allowing for similar processing methods.
