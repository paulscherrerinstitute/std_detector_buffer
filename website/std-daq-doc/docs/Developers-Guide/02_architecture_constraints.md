|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalability with Module Count               | The architecture must support scalability concerning the number of modules integrated within the designated detector. Each module represents a fixed hardware entity, necessitating a system design that accommodates varying module counts and physical configurations. |
| Storage                                     | The data flow architecture should align with the characteristics of the distributed storage system in use.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Working Set Size                            | The working set size must be accommodated within the `L3` cache of a high-performance CPU to meet the required processing speed in high-demand scenarios.                                                                                                                |
| Mellanox Cards Utilization                  | Adherence to the Mellanox technology, as utilized at PSI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| HDF5 Output File Compatibility              | The architecture should support `HDF5` file format for output files, adhering to the current usage by all beamlines and their associated clients.                                                                                                                        |
| Real-time API                               | Provision of a real-time API is essential to deliver system state feedback within a 5-second interval.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Experimental User Security Mechanism        | The project must incorporate a security mechanism for experimental users, as stipulated by PSI.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| System Restart Capability within 10 Seconds | The architecture should facilitate system configuration changes with a restart time not exceeding 10 seconds, aligning with the user tolerance for wait time.                                                                                                            |
